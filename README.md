On this dataset I have implemented various SQL concepts from basic to advance like,-

- Aggregate Functions: Sum, Average, Count etc.
- String Functions: Like, Concat, Replace.
- Logical and Comparison Operators.
- Cast and Top Clause.

- Regex Operation
- Date/Time Manipulation-datediff(), getdate(), month(), year()
- Case Statement
